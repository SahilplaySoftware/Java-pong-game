# Java Pong Game

## Description
This is a simple implementation of the classic Pong game in Java. The game simulates a two-player table tennis match, where each player controls a paddle to hit the ball and prevent it from passing them.

## Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
- A code editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA.

### Installation
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SahilplaySoftware/Java-pong-game.git
```

2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.

3. Run the `PongGame.java` file to start the game.

## How to Play
- Player 1 (Left Paddle): Control the left paddle using the `W` key to move up and the `S` key to move down.
- Player 2 (Right Paddle): Control the right paddle using the `UP` arrow key to move up and the `DOWN` arrow key to move down.

The objective is to hit the ball with your paddle in such a way that it goes past your opponent's paddle and into their goal. Each time the ball passes your opponent's paddle and enters their goal, you score a point.

The game continues until one player reaches a predefined number of points or until you choose to exit.

## Features
